## Scope :earth_americas:
**JavaScript organizes scopes with functions and blocks**<br/>

### Befor executing the code : 
scope maneger detrmine the scope
then bring data or store it in the variable

> :email: Note:
> Shadowing: Having two varibles with same name in different scopes.

### Auto Globale:
- if I try to use varible in cuurent scope without declaring it, it will be delared in the globale scope
```js
function f1 (){
    name = "ahmad"
    console.log(name)
}
h() //ahmad
```

### Disable it => Strict
```js
function f1 (){
   name = "ahmad"
    console.log(name)
}
h() // erorr
```
## Scope & Function Expressions :earth_americas:
**Named Function Expressions: Benefits** <br/>
1. Reliable function self-reference (recursion, etc)
2. More debuggable stack traces
3. More self-documenting code

### Functional Programming
> :email: Note:
> Functional programming is a good habit. It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs.
