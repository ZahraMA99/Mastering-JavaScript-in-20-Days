## Data Fetching & Promisies :golf::traffic_light:
API Fetch:

:sparkles:**Promises** can be in 3 possible states:
  1. Pending: still waiting for the value, hang tight.
  2. Fulfilled(aka"resolved"): finally got the value, all done.
  3. Rejected: sorry could't get the value, all done.<br/>=> It takes time for promises to resolve, so they are "asynchronous".
