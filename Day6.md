## Data Fetching & Promisies :golf::traffic_light:
API Fetch:

:sparkles:**Promises** can be in 3 possible states:
  1. Pending: still waiting for the value, hang tight.
  2. Fulfilled(aka"resolved"): finally got the value, all done.
  3. Rejected: sorry could't get the value, all done.<br/>
=> It takes time for promises to resolve, so they are "asynchronous".

- Are promisies only use with api calls or will we sim them in another usage? yes, we will see them in other different cases. Fetch is one example of an operation or a function that returns a promise.
