ðŸ’Œ **Note: Concept of clouser scope**
> JavaScript is a static or lexically scoped language.<br/>
> Lexical means the physical positioning on the page. ( in the last e.g on telegrame => I phisically position incremnet counter inside the running of the outer ).<br/>
> JavaScript is a lexical staticlly scope language. ( That means even i retuerned my function out, and theoritcally all this data should have been deleted, Nope! becaues I have this fundamental rule of lexical scoped language! I'll want to grap all that data behind the scenes and put it in the backpack "red bag :joy:"!!<br/>
> Such that when I run the function, I still have all the data from when I last scope. => Not because I go back into the earlier excution context !!! Becuse I pulled the data from when the function incrementCounter was born out with me on my lexical scop property.<br/>
> Behind the scense I pulled the data out and left it attached to my new function. <br/>
