## Introduction :tulip:

### JavaScript principles:
*When JavaScript code runs, it: <br/>*
- Goes through the code line-by-line and run/excutes aech line **Known as thread of excutions**.
- Saves data like strings and arrays so we can use that data later - in it's memory. We can even save code 'functions'.
- **Functions:** Code we save() ('define') functions & can use (call/invoke/execute/run) later with the function's name & {}.
- **Excution context:** Created to run the code of a function - has 2 parts (we've already seen them!):
    1. Tread of execution.
    2. Memory.<br/>
