## Asynchronous JavaScript ðŸŽ¯

#### Promises, Async & the Event Loop::blossom:
- Promises - the most signficant ES6 feature
- Asynchronicity - the feature that makes dynamic web applications possible
- The event loop - JavaScriptâ€™s triage
- Microtask queue, Callback queue and Web Browser features (APIs) <br/>

#### Asynchronicity is the backbone of modern web development in JavaScript yet!:blossom:
**JavaScript is:**
- Single threaded (one command runs at a time).
- Synchronously executed (each line is run in order the code appears).<br/>
> So what if we have a task: <br/>
> - Accessing Twitterâ€™s server to get new tweets that takes a long time <br/>
> - Code we want to run using those tweets <br/>
> - Challenge: We want to wait for the tweets to be stored in tweets so that theyâ€™re there to run displayTweets on - but no code can run in the meantime <br/>

### JavaScript is not enough - We need new pieces (some of which arenâ€™t JavaScript at all):first_quarter_moon:ðŸ’Ž
*Our core JavaScript engine has 3 main parts:*:blossom:
- Thread of execution
- Memory/variable environment
- Call stack <br/>

*We need to add some new components::blossom:*
- Web Browser APIs/Node background APIs
- Promises
- Event loop, Callback/Task queue and micro task queue <br/>
